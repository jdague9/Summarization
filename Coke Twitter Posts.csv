Backwards flip. That one exercise she didn‚Äôt finish during math. Keep your arms close. Was that biology test tomorrow? It has to be a high jump, otherwise it will fail. Maybe the test was next week. ‚ÄòTarja! Stop dreaming and focus!‚Äô The voice of the trainer echoed through the pool and she could feel the little boy on the other side of the water staring at her. She was focused, overly focused, and that was her problem. A pile of homework was still waiting for her when the training was over and she was focused on that. Focused on the teachers warning her about her grades that slowly got lower, on her mother telling her she had to quit diving if she started failing classes, but not on want her trainer wanted her to focus. Tarja took a deep breath before taking her spot at the edge of the platform. It didn‚Äôt matter how many times she went over the routine in her head, she still failed to complete the dive and landed once again almost flat on her stomach. ‚ÄòWhat do I do wrong?‚Äô She asked as she climbed out of the water and desperately looked at het trainer. ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre not focused, that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre doing wrong. As long as you can‚Äôt keep your head at the training, I can‚Äôt help you.‚Äô Tarja silently cursed the man as he looked up at the tower again. How could she focus if he didn‚Äôt tell her what to focus on? Didn‚Äôt she jump high enough? Maybe her legs weren‚Äôt stretched? Should she turn faster? She would probably never know. She glanced at the clock as she got in line again and sighed as she saw there were still 10 minutes left before the training ended. She didn‚Äôt want to dive anymore, not today. She just wanted to go home, finish her homework and drink some hot chocolate milk before going to bed. Absent minded she watched her teammates jumping from the platform while she remained leaning against the back of the ladder. The trainer probably wouldn‚Äôt even notice she wasn‚Äôt diving and most likely cared even less. A small smile played on her lips as her mind was no longer filled with stretched legs and jumps that had to be high. All she cared for at the moment was how high the mountain had to be if Jonas wanted to fly 35 meter and there was a wind of 5km/h. Her calculations were interrupted however as a loud female voice echoed through the pool and made Tarja look up, or rather down. ‚ÄòNo diving in this part! If you want to be cool in front of your friends you have to go to the other side of the pool!‚Äô The boys seemed to roll their eyes at the lifeguard before swimming to the deeper part of the pool, but Tarja couldn‚Äôt keep her eyes off the woman. She was new, Tarja was sure of that, she would have remembered those legs if she‚Äôd seen them before. The red shorts covered most of her toned thighs and the white shirt was in contrast with her long dark hair. The woman held her eyes on the boys until they were where they belonged before climbing back in her chair and Tarja imagined how the muscles in her arms clenched as she pulled herself up. ‚ÄòLooks like our dyke found a victim for this night!‚Äô One of the other girls laughed, making Tarja tear her eyes off the lifeguard. ‚ÄòLook, you‚Äôre already completely wet thinking about it.‚Äô Tarja groaned, knowing very well it was useless to defend herself by saying it was just water dripping from her ponytail. Figuring the training had to be over soon she stepped towards the edge of the platform and dived straight down, the water feeling fresh on her flustered cheeks. The first girl already disappeared in the showers as Tarja came up and she hurried to follow her. She took what was probably the shortest shower of her entire life and walked towards the locker she‚Äôd stored her clothes in before the other came into the showers. In order not to get locked out again Tarja had decided to just use a small cabin for her own instead of using the bigger one. Using the key that had been around her ankle during the training she opened the locker and reached inside to grab her bag. As soon as her fingers had closed around the fabric however she felt two hands on her back and fell forward, the locker being shut behind her. ‚ÄòLet me out of here!‚Äô Tarja shouted as she banged her fist against the door. ‚ÄòOh come on,‚Äô She heard one of her teammates laughing. ‚ÄòYou already came out of the closet once, you can do it again. Or should we get the lifeguard?‚Äô Tarja could hear their laughs fading as they walked away and hit the door one more time as she tried to push it open. The locker was small, there was just enough space for her to stand and lean against the wall, but she couldn‚Äôt even lift her foot that had gotten hurt when she was pushed in. She hoped they would come for her once they were done changing, but she doubted it. There was a good chance they would just leave her there for the cleaning staff to find her. She felt the anger raising in her body and slammed her fist against the door again, imagining it was one of her teammates. She hated them  and the only reason she hadn‚Äôt quit yet was the upcoming tournament. They wouldn‚Äôt take that from her. After she‚Äôd hit the door 5 times she suddenly heard the key turning in the lock and the door opened. She was surprised as she stood eye in eye with the new lifeguard, who seemed just as surprised to see her. ‚ÄòEhm, are you okay?‚Äô The woman asked, but Tarja didn‚Äôt answer her. She just jumped out of the locker and grabbed her bag before almost running to the first empty cabin she saw without looking back at the confused woman behind her."OlivingGingerly,I can drink a 2 liter bottle of coke zero all by myself in one day. #cokezeroyxnyvng,Home alone drinking a bottle of cream soda and vodka by myselfedwardrose1302,"Oh dear, what started as a coffee, ended in Guinness, beer, wine and curry session!

I got tired, but tried to jog at least half the length each time!) 30 seconds of a body weight exercise (I did push ups, mountain climbers etc) Straight back into sprint and repeat I did that circuit 8 times and ohhh boy&#8230; it was definitely a work out! hahaI was going to finish up with an ab workout, but by the third exercise my abs were burning so much I couldn&#8217;t do any more! Who knew sprints would kill your abs so much? When I got home I had a protein shake (1 banana, 1 scoop whey isolate, 2 cups crushed ice, 1/2 cup unsweetened almond milk, 1-2 tbsp of cocoa) and a whole grain bagel with pb and unsweetened coconut!"NickFCB76,Finally home!

C: 1. Oatmeal: Your morning snack attack is caused by a dip in blood sugar levels. Fiber-rich oatmeal stays in your stomach for hours, staving off a doughnut run. Watch out: Steer clear of the sugary flavored varieties. Choose the plain stuff, and sweeten it with berries. 2. Almonds and other nuts: Go nuts! They slim your tummy by keeping it full. A Purdue University study showed that people who ate nuts felt full longer than those who ate rice cakes. Stick to 24 almonds a day to satisfy your hunger pangs without overloading on calories. Watch out: Skip salted nuts; too much sodium raises blood pressure. 3.Protein powders: It's not just for gym rats! Protein powder contains amino acids that burn fat and build muscle. Add two teaspoons to a smoothie for a fat-busting drink. Find it at health food stores. Watch out: Make that smoothie with fruit, yogurt, and low-fat milk ‚Äî adding protein powder to a chocolate shake doesn't make it health food (we wish). 4. Olive oil: Everyone needs a little fat ‚Äî it controls hunger. Go for monounsaturated fats like olive or canola oil. They will help keep your cholesterol under control and satisfy cravings. Watch out: Steer clear of hydrogenated vegetable oils; they're loaded with unhealthy trans fat. 5. Assorted Berries: Berries stuff a lot of filling fiber into a tiny package: Just one cup of raspberries has six grams. Watch out: Jelly is the junk food of the fruit world. It has almost no fiber and contains added sugar. 6. Eggs!: Eggs contain vitamin B12, which your body needs to metabolize fat. In fact, researchers at Louisiana State University found that people who ate eggs for breakfast every day lost more weight than those who ate bagels. Watch out: Talk to your doc first if your cholesterol is high. 7.Beans: Beans are low-cal and packed with protein and fiber, which help you tone up and lose weight. Make a bean-heavy dish, such as burritos, instead of meat once a week. You'll cut a lot of saturated fat and replace it with fiber. Watch out: Refried beans are high in saturated fat. Choose plain black, pinto, or other varieties instead. 8.Whole grains: The right kinds of carbs are actually good for you. Choose whole grains ‚Äî their fiber keeps you from getting hungry. Watch out: Sometimes bread labeled ""wheat"" has been stripped of all of its fiber and nutrients. Look for ""whole grain"" or ""100 percent whole wheat."" 9. Peanut butter: Who would have guessed that a kid-friendly food could be waist-friendly, too? PB is packed with niacin, which keeps the digestive system on track and prevents belly bloat. Just keep an eye on portion size: Peanut butter does have a lot of fat, so limit yourself to no more than two tablespoons a day. Watch out: Pick all-natural PB, which doesn't contain added sugar. 10. Lean meats & fish: Your body burns more calories digesting protein than carbs or fat. Want the leanest meat out there? Opt for turkey, but to cut down even more on saturated fat, choose fish. Go for tuna and salmon; they are full of omega-3s, which help prevent stress chemicals that promote fat abs. Watch out: Cured meats and sausage have a lot of saturated fat. ********************PLEASE NOTE******************** Doing ab crunches and running will only show you results if you have no fat. These exercises are supposed to build muscles, which can be concealed by fat. So those will only show you results if you have no stomach fat. Also, the best thing to do is avoid gum and junk food, ( both of which cause stomach bloating)!"WenChriste,@amightyheart: it's only 64 cal though.

Firstly, eat the bulk of your days carbs pre and post training. 1-2.5 hours pre training I usually have around 30% of my carbs, the closer to the workout I eat, the more high gi the carbs will be in my meal. Because if I have high gi carbs like 3 hours pre training I&#8217;m going to have spiked and come down before I even start! Then post training around 35% of carbs and these can be whatever you want really.  Depending on how many carb meals a day you&#8217;re having, this may be your only two so make them count :)   Tip 2, get enough sleep. Seriously, when you&#8217;re on a calorie deficit sleep is SO important to avoid feeling lethargic.   Tip 3, drink a LOT of water. Like 4-5L a day. I know it seems excessive and difficult to keep up with but it will be the difference between you feeling crap vs full of energy   Tip 4, coffee or pre workout, anything with a stimulant. I&#8217;m not sure what your take on pre&#8217;s are but if you&#8217;re against them then feel free to have a single or double shot coffee (I&#8217;m pretty used to caffiene so I have either a double ristretto or triple shot espresso or flat white.. #coffeeaddict over here) - caffiene helps, a lot."_RanduDelgado,"RT @DiscoveryFact: If you want to burn fat faster, a cup of coffee before a workout will speed up the process."sherry_sherry1,"RT @secretsfact: If you want to burn fat faster, a cup of coffee before a workout will speed up the process."yuscoro,"RT @secretsfact: If you want to burn fat faster, a cup of coffee before a workout will speed up the process."manitsmiranda10,Chocolate milk after a workout>>>arminanton61,0wned by DodePersie #DodeOnTTI Drinking chocolate milk has been proven to help relieve muscle soreness after a workout.MichelleSCT,"Post workout eats!

Jennifer R ~ March 2013 at 29 years old I had to leave the job I loved and planned on retiring from due to pain from nearly losing my leg in a car accident. I had to have a stool to sit on to make dinner to keep my weight off my leg. My back was starting to increase in chronic pain because of my limp....... I was told I would soon need to use a cane full time which causes another set of problems because my shoulder was broken and has pain as well. I was screwed for lack of a better term. Since starting Plexus my swelling is GONE 95% of the time and went from living on pain killers of some sort 24 hours a day to only needing them once a month or so! Plexus has given me my life back. I not only can walk again with very little to no pain, I can actually jog short distances (not pretty since my range of motion isn't back lol) but this is something my doctors said would NEVER happen again!!!! Carolyn K D ~ It was hard to lay on the floor and play with my kids, bend over to kiss kids goodnight. My back would get very stiff, plus pain all around my midsection, front sides, back, that would last about three hours..crying due to the pain..could not sit, stand anything until the pain subsided. Now I can pick veggies from the garden, lay on the floor, and bend..pain is gone completely, especially if I keep drinking my amount in water. The dehydration, I never knew the pain in my midsection was because of it. I feel great   Diana M G ~ It stopped my blood sugar roller coaster. Basically cured my hypoglycemia issues. Much better sleep. And kills my sugar cravings.   Becky J ~ Energy, sleep and lower cholesterol!

It took a moment for her to remember that she wasn't in Milan any longer and didn't have to dodge her creepy landlord.  It was sheer luck that she had ran across an old friend who told her about the Araphyre Agency.     At first she didn't think that she would hear back from Arabella Wallace about the job that her friend had told her about.  She was extrememly happy  when she received an email invite from Arabella to come and interview.  It gave her an excuse to leave Italy and a lot of creeps who weren't interested in her or her artwork, just whether or not they could get into her pants.  Taking the opportunity and getting out of Milan was the best decision she had made in a while.  She would miss Milan and she would miss most of her art professors and a handful of the students but this opportunity was what was best for her at the moment.     Sitting up in her new bed and stretching, it felt good.  Moira yawned before pulling her covers off  her body.  She swung her legs over the side of the firm bed and instantly smelled the new coffeepot brewing in the kitchen.  ""Mmmmmm coffee,"" Moira said as she slipped her feet into a pair of soft fluffy bunny slippers that one of her few Italian friends had bought her for her last birthday.  Wiggling her toes inside them, she turned and picked up her watch and cell phone before walking out of her bedroom and into the kitchen.       Inhaling the freshly brewing coffee was enough to make Moira smile.  If there was one thing that Moira loved, it was her coffee.  While she waited on the pot to finish brewing, she opened the freezer and grabbed some frozen pancakes.  She heated them in the microwave while she got her coffee cup and pour some of the black gold.  When the microwave dinged, she remembered that she had forgot to purchase syrup.     ""Gahhh,"" she said to herself as she opened another cabinet and grabbed a jar of peanut butter and a knife out of one of the drawers.  She spread a thin layer of peanut butter on top of the pancakes and folded them over.  Picking up her coffee cup and plate, she moved over to the table where she had set up her laptop yesterday.  She hit the on button and ate a pancake while waiting for the laptop to boot up.     Taking a sip of coffee, she opened one of the files that Arabella had given her.  Opening a browser, she began doing what she was best at: hunting people down.  She finished off her pancakes and her cup of coffee before she had a solid lead on one of the people in the folders.  She decided that she would check out her lead after her workout.  Moira shut down her browser and cleaned up her dishes before walking back into her bedroom to change into some workout clothes.    She found one of the gyms at the compound easily enough.  Just follow the scent of sweat and testosterone.  Plugging in her earbuds, Moira decided to listen to some classic Van Halen while she did her morning run on one of the treadmills.  Being a Lykae, she could easily run without breaking a sweat at a fast pace.  She set her speed at a moderate pace to start as Running With the Devil started playing.

A reason to drink beer before noon.Ruth L Rogers,"Gulp! My latest obsession... Living healthy and having fun with my grandchildren.  I am a self proclaimed foodie and there is a very short list of things I don't enjoy eating.  That is why I am overweight.  Food is my drug of choice. I have finally come upon a way to eat that satisfies my need for variety but allows me to loose weight. I have been able to control my sugar cravings with the following approach toward food.      First of all, I want you to know I have been eating mostly Paleo for the past 14 weeks.  That means I try to stay away from sugar, dairy, legumes and grains, especially  wheat.  I focus my diet on eating meat and fish and plenty of a variety of vegetables ( organic when possible) along with nuts and fresh or frozen fruit.  I do eat potatoes (red is better) but try to eat sweet potatoes when I have a choice. I cook with coconut oil and/or olive oil.  I season with garlic (powder for convenience). Sweeten my tea with stevia and  try to stay way from other artificial sweeteners .  My almost nightly dessert is frozen fruit with shredded coconut and coconut yogurt made into a soft serve ice cream using my Yonanna .  I will say, the hardest thing was letting go of bread.  I can say I'm ok now but it took several weeks of seeking out alternatives and determining there is nothing like light fluffy bread.  I made Paleo bread but it has a lot of egg and is extremely dense.  I just had to GET OVER that need and get on with it.  I have to admit I don't miss it like I used too. I think it is because I feel so good.  I find that I am becoming a food snob.  If I'm going to eat something that I consider off my guidelines, it better be worth it and good quality.  I probably eat as described above about 90% of the time.  A few years ago I had a blood test done which pointed out some food allergies which I have confirmed with practical application.  I love eggs but they don't love me,  too many will cause extreme gas and no one wants to be around me.  Same with bananas.  Small amounts will not bother me (like an egg in  a cake) but a fried egg is not a good choice. ;-).  I think eliminating these things have contributed to my digestive health.  That said, my 10% is as follows... I will occasionally eat corn, and I can't resist a corn tortilla wrapped around grilled shrimp. Living in Texas for over 30 years, I absolutely love Mexican food and cannot totally eliminate cheese or an occasional pinto bean, though I try to limit it.  I also love barbecue though I try not to smother it in sauce.  I don't eat fried food, though I will snag some of my husband's fries if he gets too many.  I love a good burger and will try to get a lettuce wrap  with avocado and all available veggies or a Gluten free bun or (in a pinch) settle for a  regular bun and eat half of it.   I use avocado instead of mayonnaise to moisten my food but if there is mayo on something I will eat it.   I love chips so when I need that crunch I will try to eat healthier versions, sweet potato chips,  vegetable chips, baked corn tortillas ( I have to be careful not to eat too many). I love all food.  So when there is something served with pasta or rice I try to control the portion size of the ""white  stuff""and use veggies as my filler, often fresh baby spinach. Diet Coke is something I try to limit cause I tend to over indulge. Iced tea is my usual drink though water  should be. I have had birthday cake a few times and when I take my G'son to the movies I can't resist a treat but I go for quality, like dark chocolate.  In the past 14 weeks I have lost over 16 pounds eating like this AND I have been on vacation several weeks of this time. I think I can live with this approach for the rest of my life.  I have lost over 32 pounds since last October.  The first 16 was lost eating Vegan before 6.  It worked but was too restrictive for someone that likes to eat lunch out daily with her husband. I also discovered that too much soy makes my joints hurt.  Another thing that has helped me stay  on track has been an app my friend Jamie Keith recommended,  myfitnesspal.  After doing WW for years, I was not too hip on writing everything I eat,  but this approach is very painless.  I am friends with Jamie and we can see each other's successes and cheer each other on.  It has more bells and whistles than I need but you can use it to fit your needs.  Over the past couple of years I have tried to add movement to my life.  It has been a slow process but I have to admit in recent months I have started to ramp up. I started out with walking with my friend and doing water aerobics with my sweetie. I have now taken the plunge and hired a personal trainer.  I think this will escalate my weight loss and strength.  I have to admit, I'm starting to enjoy moving.    I hope this is read by someone that need encouragement.  I'm always looking for buddies to walk with or play with that want to live feeling good.

I wasn‚Äôt ready for the fun to be over! Luckily, I had one more session on the schedule ‚Äì Latintronika.  I brought some of my new The Chic Life apparel to wear around convention to test out the products, and I‚Äôm loving them so far! I love high quality clothes so I picked brands that I know and trust, like American Apparel and Bella, for shop products. I just haven‚Äôt tried all of the specific products...yet. I tested out the American Apparel zipper hoodie in ‚Äúcharcoal‚Äù, which I had printed with the Own Your Strength design. It‚Äôs super plush and very comfy. My new sweatshirt definitely kept me warm during the non-dancing portions of the sessions.  I also ordered a Bella wideneck 3/4 sleeve t-shirt in white with the CHIC print. I think I‚Äôm going to be wearing this one a lot. I especially like how it can be worn either level with a basic wideneck look or to the side for the off-the-shoulder look. I got a couple t-shirts to cut, but I never had the time to cut them! Guess I‚Äôll have to remember to cut them before convention next year.  My last breakfast at the Hilton Orlando. I‚Äôm going to miss having breakfast and hot coffee just a short walk away. Shout out to the Hilton staff for keeping everything well-stocked and clean! They did a great job!  I was really looking forward to my last session of convention ‚Äì Latintronika! This session was new to the Orlando offering this year. Melissa (Meli) was one of the best presenters I‚Äôve seen at a Zumba Convention. She was engaging, personable, informative, helpful, entertaining, strong, and soooo organized! Her session was well-structured and her session handout was perfection. I also appreciated the way she documented her choreo notes ‚Äì they were easy to follow and very clear. She even told us where we could purchase the songs (which can be surprisingly hard to find sometimes ‚Äì there are songs from past conventions I still haven‚Äôt found!).  Meli even made icons for the five new genres we learned about: Digital Cumbia Latin House or Dance House Nortec Tango Electronico Tribal (my FAVE!) I‚Äôm always on the lookout for great new music, and many of the songs I‚Äôve been drawn to recently fall into the Latintronika group. These songs are the hottest new tunes out there. Check them out! I especially like almost everything by 3BallMTY (check out ‚ÄúQuiero Bailar‚Äù and ‚ÄúTu Carita‚Äù). I also really like ‚ÄúCumbia Tribalera‚Äù by El Pelon del Microphone.  This session was not only great for learning about new genres and choreo, but we also learned a lot about how to make the choreo, moves, and overall workout effective. Meli was great about pointing out how to do the moves to work out different muscle groups and which moves worked which specific muscles. This is something I think about a lot as an instructor, so I really appreciated Meli‚Äôs attention to detail.  Great job, Meli!  {Photo courtesy of Dee} One of the highlights of my convention experience was meeting blog reader DeVonia! She introduced herself in the Latintronika session and we got to chat a little after the session ended. Her friend Thomas was a doll and took quite a few photos till we captured the above jump photo. Great meeting you, Dee! Thank you, Thomas! Hope to see you next year!  After quickly packing up back at the hotel room and finishing our leftover snacks for lunch, we hit the road for one last beach pit stop. More on that next time!

Not this time at least.) Now that classes are back in session, it means back to healthy eating and portion control. Over the summer, I realized how poorly I ate which is all thanks to my group of friends with metabolisms faster than mine. From pizza to ice cream, I basically committed every food sin out there that the only green thing on my plate was salsa verde with a side of red rice. Consequently, my body started feeling weird as a response and I was no longer losing weight despite my daily gym visits. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I love junk food as much as the next college student, but I love delicious food that&#8217;s good for me, too. I&#8217;m especially a big juice head (and by that, I&#8217;m not referring to steroids). For me, apples and kale are always a safe bet. Kale has always been one of those vegetables I ate almost everyday before the summer and completely forgot about during the summer. Hopefully, I&#8217;ll be back to healthy old me in no time.

I&#8217;m going to try something here and I hope that it works.  See&#8230;A few months ago I saw a video on Youtube about a lady who lost weight by working out for 100 days in a row. I was very inspired by this woman and therefore I began my original 100 day journey. I ate healthier options, I worked out in some fashion every night, and I saw results pretty quickly. Then I hit a bought of depression and kind of just gave up.  Months later, I&#8217;m back at it. Tonight was the first attempt I guess&#8230;I went to the gym and tried to do a workout video. Keep in mind this video&#8217;s series are in levels and when I was doing my original 100 days I was doing the hardest one. This one was the intermediate one and I stopped pretty much right away. I was so winded and already in pain after four squats. It was miserable and embarrassing (even though I was the only person in the room) I&#8217;m going to give it another try tomorrow night.I&#8217;ll do my best to document what food I eat and what drinks I drink.I&#8217;m going to start cutting down on all gluttonous behavior and really focus on my body.

I want to feel comfortable dating. I want to give it 100. I know that tomorrow never comes, but it&#8217;s 11:30 and I have a very busy day at work ahead of me tomorrow.

Fava beans are Egypt variety and use there. And the use of chickpeas is mainly in other Middle Eastern countries. So basically Falafel is an Arabic food. Chickpeas used to prepare falafel mainly in Palestinians and Yemenite Jews in Jerusalem. Actually falafel is a deep-fried ball made from flavoured chickpeas and or/fava beans, and served in a pitta bread which is known ad lafa, covered with vegetables, salads and sauces. After this you need the following items: one onion, one cup of dried chickpeas, three tablespoons of fresh parsley (chopped), three cloves of garlic(chopped), one teaspoon of cumin, one teaspoon of coriander, two tablespoons of flour, salt, olive oil and pepper Keep the chickpeas in cool water overnight. Drain them, clean them with fresh water, put them in fresh water convey to the boil for five minutes and then cook for a further hour on slow heat. Allow to cooling and then combine with garlic, parsley, onion, cumin, coriander, flour; and salt and pepper to flavour in a bowl. Complete mash by hand or combine in a food mixer processor, you should obtain a broad, reliable paste. Form this mixture into little round ball about the shape of a ping pong or squash ball and softly crush them. Fry them about five to six minute in very hot oil until there color turn into golden brown. Tasty and healthy falafel fill the ball into fresh pita bread with tomatoes, lettuce, tahini, salt and pepper. Tahini is a paste of sesame seed. Take five cups of sesame seed and 1.5 cup of olive oil. Preheat them about 350 degrees Celsius, place the sesame seeds inside for 5-10 minutes, remember that the combination should not be brown and sake them frequently with a fish slice. Cool them, then keep in a food processor with the blend and olive oil. You will get broad, gloopy but pourable texture. You can add additional olive oil as per your requirements. Falafel is made with chickpeas, so it has high in protein, very good amount of carbohydrates, and fiber. Chickpeas are less in fat and no cholesterol. Key nutrients are iron, zinc, copper, manganese, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, Vitamin C, pantothenic acid, Vitamin B, thiamine and folate. Such falafel is liked by most human being. Falafel is energetic enough to replace meatballs and hamburger patties in vegetarian dishes. Falafel can be parched to decrease the fat content related with frying, but doing so will alter the flavor and texture.   Pitajoe.com is offering Falafel NYC, Hummus NYC, Pita NYC, Mediterranean food delivery NYC and Mediterranean Food Catering NYC."RosenthalWines,"What a great day for Wine and Yoga at #RosenthalWines...now, it's time to drink!

Want to work out, but don&#8217;t have any good ideas? There are many ways to work on your personal fitness, and this article describes some great ways to have fun while working out and staying healthy.  An extremely important part of an fitness regimen is a regular rest day. This gives your muscles a chance to repair any damage they have suffered. If you don&#8217;t take a regular rest day, you are likely to suffer a damaging injury that could take you away from training for much longer than a day.  A really good way to help you get fit is to start drinking green tea. Green tea can be a great, natural alternative to coffee if you&#8217;re not much of a fan of coffee. Green tea has been proven to give the metabolism a boost and it also provides energy.  If you&#8217;re trying on a new fitness routine, remember that staying hydrated will help you maximize your benefits. Dehydration can hinder muscle development and even become dangerous. Drink at least sixteen ounces of water two hours before and after a workout. If you&#8217;ve been doing cardiovascular workouts, amp up your water intake even more to compensate for your sweating.  For sleeker looking arms, try exercises designed to improve your posture. Most posture exercises work all the major muscles in the arm, allowing them to be strengthened and toned. Try extending your arms until they&#8217;re at shoulder height, with your elbows bent and palms up. Hold this position for at least 5 seconds, then release and repeat. Performing this exercise at least 3 times weekly should have you standing straighter and leave your arms looking great.  A good, and easy exercise to try when getting into better physical shape is walking. Walking at a fast pace for fifteen to twenty minutes a day can quickly impact your fitness goals. If you stroll for thirty minutes, you can have a similar impact to your body, it will just be more gradual.  A great way to get fit is to consult with a professional bodybuilder. A lot of bodybuilders have their own web sites where they offer a service that gives you the opportunity to pay to have your own consultation with them. You can get their experienced advice on your diet and workout routine.  A good way to help you get fit is to be really certain of your goals. A lot of people want to put on muscle and shed fat at the same time. Doing both at the same time is not possible. By knowing exactly what you want, you can find the right diet and exercise program for you.  To build stronger abdominal muscles, don&#8217;t overdo it. You don&#8217;t want to do abdominal exercises every day of the week. Just like the other muscles in your body, your abs need to rest between workouts. Do your abdominal workout, just two or three days a week for the best results.  If you live near a city, there will be many different events and runs that you can participate in, such as a 5k. Sign up for the next big run in your area and commit yourself to training for it over the next couple of months. This will help increase your motivation and fat burning potential.  When doing sit-ups, it is important to protect your neck. If you don&#8217;t, you can suffer a serious neck strain. When you are doing sit-ups, put your tongue on the roof of your mouth. That will help keep your head properly aligned and prevent any muscles strains in your neck.  As stated in the beginning of this article, it may seem hard to fit a fitness regimen into your everyday routine, but it is possible. Hopefully this article has given you some great tips for fitting some fitness into your busy life. You will find that in no time at all, you&#8217;ll be feeling healthier and have much more energy.

Im down 23.6lbs and countless inches ( last time i checked it was 28 overall! ). Im gaining my life back at a slow and healthy pace with the ability to now push the plate away thanks to these amazing all natural ingredients! Having Epilepsy since i became an adult has limited what i could do or try when it comes to weight loss but Plexus was 100% approved by my neurologist. I havent had a diet coke in 6 weeks and i never thought i'd be able to say goodbye to them. I drink 1/2 my body weight in ounces of water daily and i no longer crave all that horrible junk food. Im not saying i dont munch on a handful of Cheeto's on occasion but i am saying that i make more healthier choices, i opt for more protein and veggies instead of carbs. I no longer eat out of boredom, or emotional stress. I took a leap of faith and prayed that this was the answer for me. 4 years ago i had an emergency gall bladder surgery that nearly took my life. The surgeon told my mother that if i didn't lose weight, i'd be dead in 5 years. I had tried everything up until Plexus and had just about decided that i was doomed. I was addicted to food. It was worse than any drug. I was depressed and always crying because i have 2 very young children to care for and they couldn't be without their mommy. And now, i am no longer depressed because i see the difference and i see the future and i feel so much healthier than i was! So when i messaged that annoying Plexus lady and found out all i needed to know, i decided that no amount of hard work or money could stop me from giving it one last shot. It's easy and affordable even for the lowest of budgets. Why wait? Plexus works! Message me today and allow me to help you get started on your Journey to Health. Give me 60 days as your personal mentor and guide and i can help you achieve your health goals as well. You have nothing to lose with our 60 day money back guarantee!

This has been such an amazing two months of progress that I&#8217;m just finally seeing and now I truly do want to help you on your journey as well!!! I&#8217;ll put the rest under a cut![[MORE]] Before I started working out, I was living a really, really unhealthy life. I was a couch potato, I was eating pretty much only junk, and honestly, thank GOD for my quick metabolism, or else I&#8217;d have gained a lot more than just 45 pounds.  One thing that really shocked me because I never believed it was cutting down portions, and eating smaller meals throughout the day. I have two cups of coffee every morning, still (because I have a caffeine addiction I&#8217;m willing to admit to), but now instead of just drinking coffee, I&#8217;m having something healthy, like a fruit salad, for breakfast as well. For lunch, I&#8217;m eating a small salad. And for dinner, I&#8217;ve only been having one serving of whatever we&#8217;re having.  Naturally, since I&#8217;ve cut so much of my meals in half, I&#8217;ve been hungrier, which means I&#8217;ve been snacking. But instead of grabbing a bag of chips and pop, I&#8217;ve been grabbing an orange, or making myself some mint tea at night when I crave everything.  I drink a bottle of water like every hour, which fills me up too.  As for working out, man, that&#8217;s where I have problems. I hate sweating. I feel like it&#8217;s the fucking devil, man. Nothing is worse to me than my hair slick with sweat on my forehead I hate it, which is why I was never getting anything done.  But one day, I was like, &#8220;Ashley, you were so fit in high school because you had to walk up those Pennsylvania hills to school everyday&#8221;, and I was like &#8220;tru, me, I gotta get on that again&#8221;, so, I started taking my dog on walks. And then walks turned into runs, with me chasing her around my boyfriend&#8217;s parents HUGE hilly backyard. And then I started seeing that, hey, my stomach was getting slimmer, and that really inspired me to do more. So, I started doing lunges for five minutes every day (which was the WORST because I kept timing myself and I kept looking at the seconds and that was horrid), and I went on the search for 30 day challenges because that is my JAM. I love having a set &#8220;YOU GOTTA DO THIS&#8221; schedule to look at. I&#8217;m my own personal trainer, with a work out to do list.  I found this squat challenge, and this challenge website, and this home workout website. I do the squat challenge, the 30 day ab challenge, and the no-nonsense circuit everyday, plus running a mile with my pup, and doing this kickboxing video if I&#8217;m feeling absolutely nuts. If you set your mind to it, and focus, and do it EVERY DAY (you can still do some kind of workout on your rest days, just be careful), then you can do it! Plus, I&#8217;m always here for support!

Breakfast was chocolate milk and a fruit granola bar. Lunch was a chicken burrito. Dinner was a waffle with syrup and coffee (breakfast for dinner, how awesome!). Water between all that. Exercise was great today. As I said, just walking 30 minutes was getting too easy. I noticed lately that I&#8217;m not sweating anymore, which is a sign that I need to step it up. So every 5 minutes I would switch from my usual speed to a fast walk. After the 30 minutes my heart was pounding, was quite sweaty, and my legs burned in the good workout way. After I did my usual arm exercises with more added weight stuff since my arms are getting toned, but the large fat jiggle still remains. These exercises are made to trim those down, so hopefully that works. Overall good day with the workout!

(Seriously, you&#8217;re going to show up so often in my daily posts&#8230;). But seriously, shout out to the homie for waking me up for class. I was still fashionably late because I squeezed in a shower, but it&#8217;s okay. Because of this, I had absolutely nothing in my stomach and decided to drown my hunger in water (because, for some reason, I decided not to invest any money on a breakfast bagel or milk or coffee or something). So, I suppose the hunger literally, figuratively drowned. That sentence makes complete sense in my head, but it might be the 5:00AM clock ticking. Let me just tell you about the immense delicacy that was the jalape√±o cheese bagel in the bottom left picture. It was so good that I had devoured it halfway by the time I walked to the study lounge to take my camera out. LOL. Free bagels in the food closet for the poor and hungry. :&#8217;( I APPRECIATE IT SO MUCH. THANK YOU ANONYMOUS DONOR. And thank you to the LGBT Center for the free ice cream. Anyway, the real struggle in class was that I had forgotten to charge my laptop the night before. I charged it in the morning prior to showering, but about 10-20 minutes of charging won&#8217;t do it much. When I opened it in lecture, it seemed to have gotten to 30%, and that was definitely more than needed! But then I kept it open, and it fell to 2%, which made me unbearably nervous. I proceeded to take handwritten notes. I wound up opening the laptop only to see that the battery, indeed, was a little above 30%. The screen just hadn&#8217;t updated properly. Now, I have to go through the trouble of rewriting the notes&#8230; Sigh. Lab continues to be pretty cool. There are two undergraduate students I wish I could have spoken to once; we always make really awkward eye contact, but I think both parties have established that the awkward eye contact will never result in anything more. So there it is. :( The lab tech. told me that one of them never talks, even when prompted. #sociallyawkward #canthelpit #imsorryihavefailedatmakingfriends. But y&#8217;know, still doing things on my own, kind of feeling like a boss. I did manage to go to the gym today, too! Adding onto boss-ness. It was leg day (Michelle&#8217;s favorite&#8230;), and I was happy to see that I am now somewhat capable of squatting 85 lbs. The form&#8217;s not really there yet, but I believe! Soon&#8230;  Needless to say, we rewarded ourselves well. I still live the privileged life of having friends with cars, which means that the mile to and from the grocery store. I managed to snag some chicken biscuits, wheat things, chocolate milk (NO SHAME)&#8230; and I guess, chicken and vegetables. But only the fun stuff matters. Oh, and eggs! Ugh, all of the cheap ones were taken, so we had to settle on these &#8216;extra large&#8217; eggs that were so expensive, Yoni and I split the price. We both have half a dozen eggs. I can make myself breakfast for dinner or something now. I wound up going again later with another friend to snag the ice cream &#8212; triple brownie! Haha. Kind of wish we tried the coffee and donut, but that sounds like a potentially hazardous flavor&#8230; We also grabbed pizza ingredients for our fabulous pizza rolls (see bottom right picture). They taste like hot pockets. Yum. And guilty all the same. I think that concludes my day. Before I forget&#8230; Shout out to the imaginary friend that is my pet arctic wolf.

My favorite brands tend to be Species Nutrition & About Time due to the fact that they&#8217;re the ones I have found with the shortest ingredients list (and least amount of add junk). Their flavors are pretty limited for this reason, so I decided recently to try out Cellucor&#8217;s whey protein. I figured, I could bring in a jazzy flavor for the occasional treat. The Bodybuilding store was running a promotion recently where if you bought one 2lb tub you could get 3 small sample packs for free! Naturally, how could I resist? Being that I love Red Velvet anything I decided to get a 2lb tub of their Red Velvet Cake Batter Whey and picked their Vanilla, Cor-Fetti Cake Batter, and Cinnamon Swirl for the sample packs. Funny enough, I opened up the Cinnamon Swirl first thinking it would be the one I liked the least but MAN! Cinnamon Swirl is actually the bomb! I put it through a two-tier taste test: is it good on it&#8217;s own? And does it do well when mixed with other things? When I made it as a shake with water and into pancakes with egg whites I was very satisfied! The Cor-Fetti, which I expected to fall in love with, was good but for me fell a little bit short in terms of taste. I simply didn&#8217;t taste cake batter. I think it&#8217;s not bad when in a shake and in pancakes but I prefer my Species Nutrition to the Cake Batter so I think I won&#8217;t be re-ordering that flavor. The Red Velvet, I have to say, was the biggest disappointment. It didn&#8217;t taste like Red Velvet at all to me! I have tried it in both regular shake form and in pancakes and am simply not impressed. Which sucks because it is the one I bought the most of! I haven&#8217;t tried Vanilla just yet, but I figure how can you go wrong with basic? I really want to try their Cookies N&#8217; Cream flavor, their S&#8217;Mores flavor and their Peanut Butter Marshmallow (which has gotten really good taste reviews!) Aside from that, I&#8217;ll definitely be re-ordering the Cinnamon Swirl for those times when I went a boost in flavor. For the most part though, I&#8217;ll be sticking to my Species Vanilla & Chocolate."TalulaBblogger,"@tsncblog I enjoyed your @juicetou post, id be constantly grumpy without tea - i think I need some type of detox too to kick start my diet"guidomistaeng,"@jolynekujos God fucking knows, but I do know that a fat, stumpy old man pours wine into the kid's ass and drinks from it."JackFishcake,If you eat pizza and drink alcohol daily please don't wonder why you are fat.FATbastardWine,"RT @DaphneDoo_: Get that Skinny Girl wine away from me.

Today, I wore a tee + jeans. I packed gym clothing and grabbed my jacket, and I was basically ready. So we get to school, right? And just before the bell rings, I realize, I don&#8217;t have my jacket. Stupid me forgot my stupid jacket even though it was stupidly sitting there next to me &#8230; Theater. We studied for a few minutes before taking the test. I took it. After, we talked about the guidelines for our storytelling project. Great. English. Read AR. Did vocabulary stuff. Done. Gymnastics. I honestly think today was the most productive day. And fun. Nadia and I are getting along really well. We&#8217;re like, gymnastics buddies. Lunch. I ate veggie ships and drank water. My throat is still hurting. Lucia says a sickness is going around. Nasty ass people. Spanish. I hate this class. All we do is work and more work. But Mr. Allison was so funny today. He was doing all of these actions and people were laughing at him but I was laughing at Ingrid (?). She&#8217;s funny to watch. Biology. We did a lab today. Jalen joined our group too.

But wait; are you eating and drinking the right things at the right time in order to maximize your efforts? If you really want to get the best results from all those intense training sessions, here‚Äôs what you should be eating and drinking before, during and after your workouts.  Before  Eat Carbs :Whether you‚Äôre engaging in aerobic or anaerobic activity, foods rich in complex carbohydrates, such as whole-grain pasta, rice, and bread, and fruits and vegetables, are the best sources of energy.   Have a small meal an hour beforehand  : About 30 to 60 minutes before your workout, eat a small, easily digested meal composed of complex carbs. You will train longer and harder and you won‚Äôt experience low blood sugar jitters and dizziness.

It is simply a matter of knowing the protein requirements for your particular level of activity minimum 100gms of protein per day.  Be good to your body‚Ä¶  Obviously, it can be really difficult to find the motivation to work out on a regular basis. But once you‚Äôve gotten past that point and have integrated it into your daily life, you should make that extra effort to eat properly and get the most out of your training.

Usually I wake up at 6.30 am. Even in the summer or on a holiday. My system can&#8217;t sleep for longer, because I am too excited about living. After I wake up I can make my sweet bowl of oatmeal with bananas, nuts, chocolate protein powder,raisins and a little bit of honey. And along with that comes my morning milk coffee&#8230; Damn, that sounds so hot.I can&#8217;t wait to get up and eat my oats when I go to bed.. haha.. It&#8217;s like my little ritual. I usually post pictures of my oatmeals to my instagram. Check them out, bro. Now that my oatmeal is being digested in my gut, I can prepare myself for my morning HIIT. Today is the first time I do it so early. I want to do a intense running session for 1 minute and then walk for 2 minutes. And it will take about 20-25 minutes. Actually I don&#8217;t like running. I absolutely don&#8217;t want to run. The feeling of not being able to breathe properly and wanting to faint makes me sick. But at the same time, running does wonders to my mind and body afterwards&#8230; I like to feel the power that comes along. So I just run. I suck it up and RUN for my life.. Yesterday I found myself a good workout program/plan. It seems really hard. But I&#8217;m going to try. I have been going to the gym for 4 years, but there have been no positive outcomes.. I have lost so much muscle mass, that it makes me cry. My lower back is the weakest part of my body. Damn you, eating disorder!  My body needed energy and it took the energy from my lovely muscles, that I want to regrow. So I gotta eat. And eat. And eat. I want to eat at least 2200 calories every day. But you know what? My orthorexic brain tells me to eat only 1700.  BUT NOT ANYMORE. I&#8217;M GONNA RUN, LIFT, EAT, TAKE MY PROTEIN, SLEEP AND REPEAT. "requiehm,"Sure! Let&#8217;s take this piece by piece. First things first (I&#8217;m the realest), don&#8217;t think of eating healthy or exercising as these big huge lifestyles you have to jump right into. Take things as slow as you need to to be successful - taking the easy way out (skipping meals, etc.) is unhealthy and what weight you lose is short-lived, anyway. So, here are the tips I have on eating healthy that have proven to be successful for me: Don&#8217;t do everything at once. If you try to cut out soda, carbs, sugary foods, and everything else all at the same time, you&#8217;re setting yourself up for failure. I started out with what I loved the most - soda. It&#8217;s my absolute downfall, so I started with it first to make everything after seem minuscule by comparison. It was tough, but I found it was easiest for me to take it day by day. Some people like to plan out the week ahead of them, but I found that to be a little scary and made it seem too big for me to handle, so I woke up in the morning and said, &#8220;okay, today, I&#8217;m gonna only drink x amount of soda!&#8221; and I shrunk that amount down until I wasn&#8217;t drinking any soda at all. To add to that last part, don&#8217;t try to cut any one thing out all at the same time. Don&#8217;t try to go from drinking three glasses of soda a day to none at all, because again, that&#8217;s just setting you up for failure. Set reasonable goals for yourself; pace yourself. Take however long you need for each thing you want to cut out of your diet. For every bad thing you cut out of your diet, add something healthy. But make sure it&#8217;s something you like! If you don&#8217;t really enjoy what you eat/drink, it won&#8217;t last, and you&#8217;ll fall back into old habits. Moderation is key. Having a bad day? Sad? Sick? Mother nature hit you? Eat that chocolate bar. Do what makes you happy. You don&#8217;t even need a legitimate reason like being sad or cramping - if you just really, really, want it, and it&#8217;s making you miserable and you just can&#8217;t get your mind off of it, go for it. As long as you&#8217;re not totally giving up your efforts to eat healthy, I see no problem with allowing yourself a treat every once in a while. It helped me have the most success. Make sure you have a healthy balance of carbs and protein. Without carbs, your body goes into ketosis, where it wastes the protein. Protein builds muscle, but carbs allow you to do so. Meal prepping is really great way to make sure you succeed in eating healthier. It&#8217;s not easy for everyone, because not all of us have living situations in which we can meal prep, but if you have the means to I definitely recommend it. Meal prepping is planning out/cooking your meals for the week so they&#8217;re there when you&#8217;re ready to eat them. Anddd here are my tips on introducing exercise to your lifestyle: Like eating healthy, you&#8217;ve gotta take it slow. You can&#8217;t go from not exercising at all to curling Great Danes and smashing eggs into a cup. Pick out some reasonable exercises for whatever it is you want to work out and pace yourself. Your workout isn&#8217;t over once the burn starts. That&#8217;s when the workout&#8217;s just gotten good! Push through the burn, get through that last home stretch and whatever you&#8217;re working out will start to feel like a breeze. There&#8217;s a difference between feeling the burn and actually hurting something. If you feel like you&#8217;ve really hurt something, stop! Don&#8217;t try to push through the pain because you&#8217;ll just hurt yourself worse. If it&#8217;s really bad, ask a gym employee for help (assuming you&#8217;re at the gym). If the pain persists, see a doctor. Eat carbs before your workout. It gives you the energy you need and keeps your hunger at ease through the full length of your workout. Eat protein after your workout - it helps your muscles recover and helps them grow. Cardio is a great way to lose those first few pounds in starting your workout. It&#8217;s great for losing tummy fat, and toning your legs and butt! If you don&#8217;t like running, if you&#8217;re a part of a gym you can also use the stair climber or elliptical. I, personally, hate running, so the elliptical is my best friend at the gym. Everyone hits a plateau. A plateau is when you&#8217;ve stopped losing weight because your body is used to the workouts you&#8217;ve been doing. To get out of this zone, try switching up your workouts, or increasing/decreasing the intensities of different workouts. Do this for a week or so and it should help. That&#8217;s really all I have for now. I&#8217;ve tried each of these things and they&#8217;ve all worked for me, but everyone&#8217;s body is different so everybody&#8217;s results will vary. I wish you the best in your quest for a healthy lifestyle!"ShaolinShogun,Calm down 'Fitbit' joggers.

Firstly, eat the bulk of your days carbs pre and post training. 1-2.5 hours pre training I usually have around 30% of my carbs, the closer to the workout I eat, the more high gi the carbs will be in my meal. Because if I have high gi carbs like 3 hours pre training I&#8217;m going to have spiked and come down before I even start! Then post training around 35% of carbs and these can be whatever you want really.  Depending on how many carb meals a day you&#8217;re having, this may be your only two so make them count :)   Tip 2, get enough sleep. Seriously, when you&#8217;re on a calorie deficit sleep is SO important to avoid feeling lethargic.   Tip 3, drink a LOT of water. Like 4-5L a day. I know it seems excessive and difficult to keep up with but it will be the difference between you feeling crap vs full of energy   Tip 4, coffee or pre workout, anything with a stimulant. I&#8217;m not sure what your take on pre&#8217;s are but if you&#8217;re against them then feel free to have a single or double shot coffee (I&#8217;m pretty used to caffiene so I have either a double ristretto or triple shot espresso or flat white.. #coffeeaddict over here) - caffiene helps, a lot."jrgarcia_33,Work got me wanting to lay on the couch & drink beer till I pass outwithanA,One hour gym sesh complete.

I would avoid anything processed, and stay away from white bread and opt for whole grain. Stay really hydrated! Eat foods that are easy on your stomach to avoid stomach pains the next day such as vegetables, fruits, etc. I would probably make seafood (Im a vegetarian, but for you this should be fine!)because its easy on the digestive system and is filled with omega 3 fatty acids. Seafood is really good for you! Whats most important is the meal before you actually run. The morning of your 5k, drink some coconut water (This is a natural drink similar to Gatorade/Powerade), eat a banana, whole wheat bagel, and I tend to eat a clif bar or something before I run.

However, I love my little blog bubble and I&#8217;d love to keep on writing. Malm√∂ isn&#8217;t Tokyo or London.. and definitely not Amsterdam yet it has a lot of personality. I&#8217;d like to take you with me showing you more of my life in Sweden, studying abroad, veganism, preparations for the halfmarathon, trips around Scandinavia and  whatever comes into my mind. There will always be something to write about - if you&#8217;re interested or not is completely up to you. If you are - you&#8217;re welcome here. Get comfy. This month I&#8217;ve been celebrating my anniversary of 5 years being a vegetarian. Hooray! So besides one package of vegetarian sausage my fridge has turned into a vegan. And there&#8217;s no food I love that I couldn&#8217;t replace somehow with something better and cruelty free. Besides living a vegan lifestyle I&#8217;ve also turned the rest of my groceries from &#8220;not really rubbish but could need an improvement&#8221; to super-foods. Everything&#8217;s healthy besides the piece of chocolate you need from time to time or the bottle of Coke I allow myself once a week. But that&#8217;s alright. Veganism itself is not only about sacrificing things you love but also about learning how to enjoy food again. Honestly? I think about food a lot. All the time. I&#8217;ve been dieting my whole life. But since I&#8217;ve been to Asia I&#8217;ve lost a lot of weight and I&#8217;d trace this back to striking milk, cheese and eggs out off my diet&#8230; and of course 40¬∞C all day long. It was the best thing to come back from Asia and fit back into my jeans from 3 years ago. This motivated me massively and I hope this motivation will stay for good.   The infamous jeans! I wouldn&#8217;t wear them out in public yet but the button closes - let&#8217;s count this as &#8220;fits again&#8221;. So damn happy.    Avocado and yellow pepper based salad   Red lentils - vegan minced &#8220;meat&~ #8221;- Tomatos - rucola = YUMMY!      Once a week an &#8220;unhealthy&~ #8221; meal is acceptable!

The university is very young (only established in 1998) hence everything is super modern and new. The Swedes are all about equality and you can feel this when listening to teachers and university staff - they don&#8217;t feel superior. You&#8217;d rather get the feeling that they&#8217;re ashamed than proud to have a title.  My first real lecture will be on Tuesday and I am curious to meet everyone and getting started.

By using the correct effective techniques, eating right, and thinking positively, you can build muscle as well as any bodybuilder. Here are some tips to help you.  Don&#8217;t try to focus on both cardio and strength at the same time. This is not to say you should not perform cardiovascular exercises when you are attempting to build muscle. In fact, cardio is an important part of physical fitness. However, you should not heavily train cardio, such as preparing for a marathon, if you are trying to focus on building muscle. The two types of exercises can conflict, minimizing effectiveness on both fronts.Use caution when taking creating supplements for long periods of time. You can develop severe kidney problems with prolonged creatine use. They can also cause cramping, heart arrhythmia, and compartment syndrome. Teenagers could be at even more risk than adults. Stick closely to the instructions when taking supplements.Prepare your body for your weight training. You must consume about twenty grams of protein thirty minutes prior to your session. This will amplify the muscle building that takes place as you lift. This is a simple as drinking a couple of glasses of cold milk before you weight train, as well as after.Use visualization exercises to picture what you need to do to reach your goals. Having vague, undefined goals with no real sense of how to accomplish them is a sure road to failure. Picture yourself sticking to your workout routine and visualize what you will look like in the future. This will keep you motivated.Spread your workouts out so that you are only lifting weights every other day. Spend one day working out your entire body, and then use the next day to rest. Your muscles will grow while you rest, not while you are working out. Even though it might feel like you are doing nothing on your days off, your body is still working hard.In order to build lean muscle you need to work out three to four times per week. You should do workouts that use all the muscles in your body, as this will help you to lose weight quickly and strengthen your muscles at the same time. Working out every day can cause your body to become injured and would be counterproductive.It is difficult to lose weight and build muscle at the same time. You have to have a high-protein diet to support your muscle growth, but reduce your fat intake at the same time. Eat foods that are high in protein and low in fat and refined carbohydrates to reduce weight and gain muscle at the same time.Take these tips and use them as a springboard to a healthier life with more muscles. You don&#8217;t have to be a bodybuilder to use these methods, but even bodybuilders can benefit from the information in this article. Build up those muscles and be proud of the results you attain."brandondenny42,I drink protein shakes cause there so good but I don't always work out üòÇüëåryder-healynn,"I know the weeks been kind of long but I hope every can come over tonight!

But wait; are you eating and drinking the right things at the right time in order to maximize your efforts? If you really want to get the best results from all those intense training sessions, here‚Äôs what you should be eating and drinking before, during and after your workouts. Before Eat Carbs :Whether you‚Äôre engaging in aerobic or anaerobic activity, foods rich in complex carbohydrates, such as whole-grain pasta, rice, and bread, and fruits and vegetables, are the best sources of energy. Have a small meal an hour beforehand : About 30 to 60 minutes before your workout, eat a small, easily digested meal composed of complex carbs. You will train longer and harder and you won‚Äôt experience low blood sugar jitters and dizziness. Drink large quantities of water one or two hours before exercising to hyper hydrate your body and allow enough time for adequate hydration and urination. Here‚Äôs what you have to do during your workout and after you‚Äôre done‚Ä¶ During Get an extra boost During prolonged periods of intense exercise (1¬Ω hours or more at an intensity of over 50% of heart rate reserve), sports drinks can also be useful.Carry Glucon D Mixture in bottle.Most sports drinks are composed of simple carbohydrates (sugars) and electrolytes. avoid such as fruit juices and sodas during exercise. After Right after ‚Äî more Carbs :Immediately after your workout, have a small snack that is rich in carbs in order to restore your muscle-glycogen levels some easy sugar sources. I prefer having snickers.

By following these simple guidelines, you‚Äôll find that your performance, energy level and results will vastly improve... Warm welcome all , spread the word of Being Healthy !!!! Ankit"fantasyhealth,"By Carla PryesEveryone knows staying fit is important, especially with obesity rates in America rising quickly. Want to work out, but don&#8217;t have any good ideas? There are many ways to work on your personal fitness, and this article describes some great ways to have fun while working out and staying healthy.  An extremely important part of an fitness regimen is a regular rest day. This gives your muscles a chance to repair any damage they have suffered. If you don&#8217;t take a regular rest day, you are likely to suffer a damaging injury that could take you away from training for much longer than a day.  A really good way to help you get fit is to start drinking green tea. Green tea can be a great, natural alternative to coffee if you&#8217;re not much of a fan of coffee. Green tea has been proven to give the metabolism a boost and it also provides energy.  To get great looking abs, only do abdominal muscles 3 days a week. While working your abs daily may seem like the right thing to do, your abs actually need time to recuperate in between workouts. Taking a break and working on another part of your body will give your muscles the rest they need to get toned.  Determine what you are trying to accomplish with your workouts and write it down. Maybe you are trying to lose weight, gain strength, or just stay young longer. Writing down what you are doing and why will help you stay motivated and help you pinpoint items that you need to focus on.  Be accountable for the exercise you do. Try joining a gym just because spending the money makes you more likely to be there and using those resources. If you can&#8217;t join a gym, pair up with a friend or two so that you can support each other. Being accountable to someone or something makes you more likely to stick with your workouts.  A great way to get fit is to consult with a professional bodybuilder. A lot of bodybuilders have their own web sites where they offer a service that gives you the opportunity to pay to have your own consultation with them. You can get their experienced advice on your diet and workout routine.  A good way to help you get fit is to be really certain of your goals. A lot of people want to put on muscle and shed fat at the same time. Doing both at the same time is not possible. By knowing exactly what you want, you can find the right diet and exercise program for you.  To build stronger abdominal muscles, don&#8217;t overdo it. You don&#8217;t want to do abdominal exercises every day of the week. Just like the other muscles in your body, your abs need to rest between workouts. Do your abdominal workout, just two or three days a week for the best results.  Eat as soon as you finish your workout routine. This is not counter-productive as long as you eat the right foods. After a strenuous workout, you need carbohydrates and proteins. So head off to find a shake that contains both of them. Either of them will help, but you get the most benefit when they are combined.  If you want your kids to get more exercise, try making it a competition. Buy everyone in your family a pedometer. Each day mark down how many steps each person has walked. At the end of the week, tally the totals up and see who the winner is. Come up with a good prize for the winner - a new toy, an extra desert, or getting to choose dinner for the night.  Staying fit can be difficult until you get in the habit of working out, but if you stick with it you will be rewarded with a great looking body. Hopefully you now have some great fitness ideas and are eager to apply them to your next run around the block or trip to the gym.

I drank the daytime tea this morning and I did a short workout. I already feel more energetic than normal. I&#8217;m just doing this detox to cleanse my body so that I can really get started on being healthy. I&#8217;m going to be more active and eat healthier foods. I&#8217;ve noticed that when I cut things out cold turkey, I always quit after like a week. So I&#8217;m going to take this slow at first. I don&#8217;t want to quit anymore. I&#8217;m doing this because I just want to have more energy everyday. And even though working out gives me headaches and I hardly have enough energy to do anything after work, I&#8217;m going to do it anyway. I&#8217;m just gonna fight through the obstacles and hopefully those bumps in the road will disappear after awhile. I&#8217;m not doing any of this to be skinny. If you&#8217;re naturally skinny or you want to be skinny, that&#8217;s wonderful. I am proud of you for your dedication. But my goal is more for health reasons and internal beauty is my main focus. I don&#8217;t mind my thunder thighs or my fatty stomach right now. When I focus on removing those jiggly bits, negative thoughts always slither their way into my head and it&#8217;s all I can think about. I start to hate myself. And I&#8217;ve come so far with loving who I am that I don&#8217;t want to risk losing it. Instagram has really become helpful in my journey to self love. There are so many wonderful, inspirational people on here and they keep me from falling back into that unhealthy hatred. I am so grateful to everyone who uses their Instagram to inspire and help others. And I want to help people love themselves too. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m posting so many cheesy self love pictures. I want to put positive words out into the world in hopes that someone in need will read them and know that they are not alone and that they are loved.  &#8220;I am learning every day to allow the space between where I am and where I want to be to inspire me and not terrify me.&#8221; -Tracee Ellis Ross #healthonmyterms #selflove #honormycurves #bootea #teatox #healthyisthenewskinny"beautifulsimplehealth,"Spring time is making me crave more and more smoothie bowls so today&#8217;s post workout snack was a big Banana & Greens smoothie bowl packed with kale, spinach, 2 medium ripe nanas, @loving_earth Maca + lucuma, coconut water üí¶ then topped with kiwi fruit, strawberries, blueberries  + buckwheat, goji berries, sunflower & chia seeds for crunch üí™ üçì  Oh and a lovely quote to share with you all:  &#8220;Poor health is not caused by something you don&#8217;t have; it&#8217;s caused by disturbing something that you already have.

The candle I lit as I walked into the bedroom I almost gone, I&#8217;ve burned it nearly to the ground, it&#8217;s my favorite scent of mulled cider. I have to remember to pick up more candles.. I bought it a while back from this store in Eureka, everything there is organic and expensive; but it&#8217;s worth it for the atmosphere. Most of the city was built in the 1880s, the roads and sidewalks are bent and twisty, businesses, homes and apartment complexes blend so well with the wonky Arkansas terrane it all looks so amazing; at least to me it does, it must be even more brilliant in the fall.  It&#8217;s 9&#160;o&~ #8217;clock now, still lying in bed listening to jazz, the candle still burning. I should probably wash my make up off, but that would ruin the mood and I&#8217;m far too lazy to be disturbed. What a wonderful night, I  wish I could end all my nights like this.. But then it would lose it&#8217;s luster, too much of a good thing, right. I think the monotony only ruins things that weren&#8217;t good to begin with or at least makes them worse. If you do something you love all your life you die happy don&#8217;t you? Or is dying happy just something we made up so we can feel better about engulfing in possibly selfish desires? Hm, let&#8217;s not get into that, it&#8217;s too depressing/deep and I&#8217;m not in the mood.. Or rather I don&#8217;t want to ruin my current mood with a bad one.

Breakfast is king! Break is king and is your biggest and most filling meal of the day. Skipping breakfast for any reason is a step in the wrong direction. According to sports nutritionist Leslie Bonci R.D. of the university of Pittsburg medical center, &#8221; skipping breakfast may reduce your metabolic rate by up to 10 percent.&#8221; My first question to the clients as we workout is what did you have for breakfast? Most of the time what I hear is, I didn&#8217;t have anything, or a cup of coffee. Wrong answer! Do your body a favor by starting you day off on a good foot with a hearty breakfast. So what should you eat in the morning? Heres the basics. Try eating a primarily protein based meal with slow digesting carbohydrates(low gylcemic - low glycemic foods are those that cause minor changes in blood sugar levels). According to ehow.com &#8220;There are classes of carbs. Monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides.&#8221; Polysaccharides(pumpkin seeds, beets, flaxseeds) are your slow digesting carbs and are found in a variety of vegetables and whole grains. A great choice for your morning carbohydrate is steel cut oats.   You&#8217;ll find steel cut oats in the bulk bins of most major grocery chains. You can prepare steel cut oats just like instant oatmeal, but won&#8217;t have the added sugars that you&#8217;ll find in the pre package packets in the grocery isles. Steel oats wil leave you feeling full and provides a good source of morning fiber. Throw some berries, and bananas in a bowl with some oats,  one to two hardboiled eggs and some greens and your on your way to a strong start to your day.

Your body is a very complex machine and it is important to know the proper techniques in order to get this done. The following article will help you with what you need to know.  Focus on working out your largest muscle groups. Concentrating your efforts on large muscle groups such as the back, chest and legs will help you to build muscle faster. Exercises such as squats, pull-ups, bench presses, and dips are ideal for this. These kinds of exercises are generally more intense, and will help boost your protein synthesis.When attempting to build muscle mass, it is important to ingest the right foods. If your efforts to add bulk are stagnating, it could be because you have an insufficient nutritional intake. To add bulk, you need to consume at least 4000-6000 calories each day from foods, which are calorie dense. Some examples of calorie-dense foods are pasta, nuts, eggs, bagels, trail mix and steaks. Since vegetables have low calorie-density, keep their intake to a minimum.Milk is a wonderful drink that will offer you many vitamins that are needed when you are trying to build muscle. You have heard as a kid that drinking milk will make you grow, and they have found that is also the case with adults and muscles. Enjoy 3 cups a day, and it will help you out.Prepare your body for your weight training. You must consume about twenty grams of protein thirty minutes prior to your session. This will amplify the muscle building that takes place as you lift. This is a simple as drinking a couple of glasses of cold milk before you weight train, as well as after.Carbs are a key component to building muscle. Carbohydrates fuel your body to allow it to perform the exercises that you need to do each day. If your training is extensive, you may need to increase your daily consumption of carbs to 2-3 grams for every pound you weigh.Do not overwork your body. In order to build muscle mass, your body needs a chance to recuperate. When starting out, work your upper on one day, then work your lower body the next day. Take one day off each week where you do no workouts at all. This will make the workout less of a job.A great tip for growing muscle that is often overlooked is getting an adequate amount of sleep. Your body heals itself and changes while sleeping. Therefore, if you don&#8217;t get enough of it, you aren&#8217;t allowing your body the chance to do these things. If you are working out hard, aim for at least eight hours of sleep, if not more.As you can see there are plenty of things that you can do that will help you build your muscles the right way. So whatever your motivation is for wanting to build muscles, be sure to keep the information you just read in mind. It will help you get the body you want without any injuries."brainbodybite,"  SO MUCH YUM AH! so I froze chunks of butternut squash over night, and then after my long run, made a delicious, huge batch of protein &#8220;nice&~ #8221; cream.

The first two times, I lost weight like nobody&#8217;s business- 30-35 pounds in a couple months, WITHOUT exercising. Just plain ol&#8217; low carb, high fat, and portion control. So- I started Keto again about a month ago, this time with a full gym membership. 4-5 days a week, I workout hard. Heavy weights, and 20-30 minutes of moderate cardio. This time? After a month? 10 pounds. It was 13, but after leg day, I took a 3 day rest and apparently GAINED 3lbs. The only thing I&#8217;m doing different this time is a little extra protein (Because the tons of lifting). Oh, and this time, compared to last time, I&#8217;ve cut almost ALL diet soda (I may have 1 when we go out to eat) and alcohol consumption. Oh, and my ketostix? Always purple.

Metabolism is often a quite significant one. Your metabolic rate is the rate at which you burn calories in breaking down food for energy. Many people have metabolisms that are operating below peak rates. I hope to help you rev up yours by taking a handful of steps.  While genes and age impact everyone&#8217;s metabolism, a substantial amount of our metabolic rate is under our own control. These action steps are the focus of this article, which are research based and all natural ways to boost your metabolism.  Different macronutrients (protein, carbs, and fat) require different energy expenditures by the body in order to digest the food. Protein burns roughly 5x-6x more calories during digestion than a similar amount of calories of fat and about 3x more than carbohydrates. Eat your weight in protein grams and see your metabolic rate soar.  I highly recommend increasing your water intake. First, it will help your kidneys better digest your increased consumption of protein from the previous step. But it also has its own metabolic kicker of its own. Dehydration can limit proper functioning of metabolism so proper hydration is necessary. Drink an ounce of H2O for every pound you weight. Add a cup of water for every fifteen minutes of exercise you do during the day. Ice water can take your water consumption up another level as it adds the thermo effect to the aforementioned benefits. Cold water needs to be warmed up to match the temperature of the rest of your body.  Frequent, small- to medium-sized meals also boost metabolism. It&#8217;s best to target at least five meals, if not six or seven. Eat a few hundred calories every few hours rather than 800-1000 three times a day. Try to get at least 15g of protein in each meal. It helps to get into a rhythm, too. If you eat seven meals today and two tomorrow, it will mess with the thermal effect of your food. I also recommend eating breakfast within an hour of waking up and with a good amount of protein.  I also recommend eating whole foods rather than those that are processed and typically loaded with chemicals, sugar, and fat. If you choose to eat a packaged food, make sure you read the food labels to understand the nutrition content of the food and what other harmful chemicals and additives may be in your food. Something like high fructose corn syrup tricks your brain and body and doesn&#8217;t stimulate an insulin response, which can lead to overeating.  Exercise also plays a big role in increasing metabolism. I recommend weight lifting at least three times a week. Use weights that will drive you to failure at no more than twelve reps. Six to ten is an excellent range to target. Also, having more muscle means more calories burned. In terms of cardio, I recommend interval training, which flip flops between sprints and slower movements. You can get a great cardio workout in only twenty minutes instead of running five miles in an hour.  If you want your metabolism, brain, and overall body to function at its best, it is important to get a good night&#8217;s sleep. Although sleep may not impact metabolism directly, a lack of it can cause you to crave unhealthy foods and skip workouts. Get the proper rest.  I caution everyone on the use of diet pills and other quick fixes. These rarely have a positive, long-term impact. If they did, our country wouldn&#8217;t have the obesity rate it does.

My latest obsession... Living healthy and having fun with my grandchildren.  I am a self proclaimed foodie and there is a very short list of things I don't enjoy eating.  That is why I am overweight.  Food is my drug of choice. I have finally come upon a way to eat that satisfies my need for variety but allows me to loose weight. I have been able to control my sugar cravings with the following approach toward food.      First of all, I want you to know I have been eating mostly Paleo for the past 14 weeks.  That means I try to stay away from sugar, dairy, legumes and grains, especially  wheat.  I focus my diet on eating meat and fish and plenty of a variety of vegetables ( organic when possible) along with nuts and fresh or frozen fruit.  I do eat potatoes (red is better) but try to eat sweet potatoes when I have a choice. I cook with coconut oil and/or olive oil.  I season with garlic (powder for convenience). Sweeten my tea with stevia and  try to stay way from other artificial sweeteners .  My almost nightly dessert is frozen fruit with shredded coconut and coconut yogurt made into a soft serve ice cream using my Yonanna .  I will say, the hardest thing was letting go of bread.  I can say I'm ok now but it took several weeks of seeking out alternatives and determining there is nothing like light fluffy bread.  I made Paleo bread but it has a lot of egg and is extremely dense.  I just had to GET OVER that need and get on with it.  I have to admit I don't miss it like I used too. I think it is because I feel so good.  I find that I am becoming a food snob.  If I'm going to eat something that I consider off my guidelines, it better be worth it and good quality.  I probably eat as described above about 90% of the time.  A few years ago I had a blood test done which pointed out some food allergies which I have confirmed with practical application.  I love eggs but they don't love me,  too many will cause extreme gas and no one wants to be around me.  Same with bananas.  Small amounts will not bother me (like an egg in  a cake) but a fried egg is not a good choice. ;-).  I think eliminating these things have contributed to my digestive health.  That said, my 10% is as follows... I will occasionally eat corn, and I can't resist a corn tortilla wrapped around grilled shrimp. Living in Texas for over 30 years, I absolutely love Mexican food and cannot totally eliminate cheese or an occasional pinto bean, though I try to limit it.  I also love barbecue though I try not to smother it in sauce.  I don't eat fried food, though I will snag some of my husband's fries if he gets too many.  I love a good burger and will try to get a lettuce wrap  with avocado and all available veggies or a Gluten free bun or (in a pinch) settle for a  regular bun and eat half of it.   I use avocado instead of mayonnaise to moisten my food but if there is mayo on something I will eat it.   I love chips so when I need that crunch I will try to eat healthier versions, sweet potato chips,  vegetable chips, baked corn tortillas ( I have to be careful not to eat too many). I love all food.  So when there is something served with pasta or rice I try to control the portion size of the ""white  stuff""and use veggies as my filler, often fresh baby spinach. Diet Coke is something I try to limit cause I tend to over indulge. Iced tea is my usual drink though water  should be. I have had birthday cake a few times and when I take my G'son to the movies I can't resist a treat but I go for quality, like dark chocolate.  In the past 14 weeks I have lost over 16 pounds eating like this AND I have been on vacation several weeks of this time. I think I can live with this approach for the rest of my life.  I have lost over 32 pounds since last October.  The first 16 was lost eating Vegan before 6.  It worked but was too restrictive for someone that likes to eat lunch out daily with her husband. I also discovered that too much soy makes my joints hurt.  Another thing that has helped me stay  on track has been an app my friend Jamie Keith recommended,  myfitnesspal.  After doing WW for years, I was not too hip on writing everything I eat,  but this approach is very painless.  I am friends with Jamie and we can see each other's successes and cheer each other on.  It has more bells and whistles than I need but you can use it to fit your needs.  Over the past couple of years I have tried to add movement to my life.  It has been a slow process but I have to admit in recent months I have started to ramp up. I started out with walking with my friend and doing water aerobics with my sweetie. I have now taken the plunge and hired a personal trainer.  I think this will escalate my weight loss and strength.  I have to admit, I'm starting to enjoy moving.    I hope this is read by someone that need encouragement.  I'm always looking for buddies to walk with or play with that want to live feeling good.

Some of the amino acids from proteins are designated nonessential. This means they do not have to come from the diet because they can be synthesized by the body from other amino acids. Other amino acids  are considered essential, meaning that the body cannot synthesize them, and therefore must obtain them from the diet. Whenever the body makes a protein - when it builds muscle, for instance - it needs a variety of amino acids for the protein-making process. These amino acids may come from dietary protein or from the body&#8217;s own pool of amino acids.  Dietary proteins are considered to belong to two different groups, depending on the amino acids they provide. Complete proteins: Complete proteins contain ample amounts of all the essential amino acids. They are found in meat, fish, poultry, cheese, eggs, and milk. Note: All soybean products, such as tofu and soymilk, are complete proteins. Incomplete proteins:Incomplete proteins contain only some of the essential amino acids. These proteins are found in a variety of foods, including grains, legumes, and leafy green vegetables. To make a complete protein, combine beans with any one of the following: brown rice corn nuts seeds wheat OR combine brown rice with any one of the following: beans nuts seeds You want to make sure to get 50 - 60 grams of protein a day. To make sure that you are getting enough variety of amino acids in your diet, add protein-rich foods to meals and snacks as often as possible. Note: A combination of any grains, any nuts and seeds, any legumes (such as beans, peanuts, and peas), and a variety of mixed vegetables will make a complete protein.

Here are 18 ways to lose weight without going on a diet.1. Instead of drinking orange juice at breakfast, eat a whole orange. You&#8217;ll save about 45 calories.2. Make your breakfast omelette with four egg whites plus 1/4 cup egg substitute. Replace regular bacon with Canadian bacon to save even more calories.3. Switch from whole milk to nonfat or lowfat milk. Use sugar substitute instead of sugar in your morning coffee or latte.4. At lunch, use mustard instead of mayonnaise on your sandwich to save 100 calories (per tablespoon) . Eliminate the cheese and save 100 more calories.5. Instead of a Big Mac and large fries, go for a plain hamburger and a small french fry and save a whopping 590 calories!6. Don&#8217;t eat potato chips at snack time. Have an apple instead for less calories plus the added benefit of more fiber.7. Substitute diet cola or iced tea for your usual soda. You&#8217;ll save 150-200 calories per drink.8. Eat every two to three hours with smaller portions. Don&#8217;t skip breakfast! Eating small, frequent meals keeps blood glucose levels stable and minimizes the impulse to overeat.9. Eat more healthy snacks like dried fruits and nuts, fresh fruits, cut up veggies or yogurt.10. Substitute whole grain foods for white bread, rice and cereals. You will not only cut fat and calories, but whole grains have been proven to reduce the risk of colon cancer by increasing the fiber that your body needs.11. Saute meat, chicken and vegetables in broth instead of butter. And speaking of butter: replace it with nonfat sour cream on baked potatoes.12. Instead of Caesar salad, substitute a dinner sald with nonfat salad dressing.13. Do you love pasta? Have spaghetti with marinara sauce instead of fettuccini with Alfredo sauce. You&#8217;ll save at least 500 calories!14. When you&#8217;re going out with friends, watch your alcohol intake. Instead of using Coke or Seven-Up with your drinks, choose tonic water or seltzer.15. Restaurants are notorious for their huge serving sizes. Eat only half of your dinner and save the rest for lunch tomorrow. Or simply share the meal with a friend.16. Get moving. Walk to the store instead of driving. Walking is the best exercise you can do to lose weight.17. Get more walking time by replacing coffee breaks with exercise breaks. Also use half of your lunch break to take a brisk walk with a co-worker.18. Swim, swim, swim. By swimming for just an hour you can burn 500 calories. You&#8217;ll also end up with a firmer, more toned body.You don&#8217;t have to go on a strict diet to lose weight. Change to more sensible eating habits and start moving your body by walking, swimming or bicycle riding. You&#8217;ll be rewarded by good health and a fit body.
